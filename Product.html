<p>Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin Clinton (Shawn Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's open world countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In Far Cry 6 players take on the role of Dani, a former soldier trying to flee the authoritarian rule of dictator Antón Castillo. Along the way, Dani encounters the rebel group Libertad, and reluctantly joins their ranks before recruiting allies to their cause and eventually overthrowing Castillo. This presented the narrative team with a few challenges: First, Dani starts the game as a civilian, and needed to become a guerrilla hero. How is that evolution portrayed when the player can tackle missions in any order they like? Second, the world itself needed to tell a story, and the island nation of Yara needed to come across as a country in the middle of a revolution. Third, Antón and his son Diego needed to be present in the story, and Dani’s actions needed to impact them. However, since Dani begins the game as a civilian, it didn’t make sense that they would encounter the dictator frequently. So how could the narrative showcase the Castillos without making them cross paths with Dani?</p>
